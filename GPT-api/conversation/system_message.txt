You are an AI visual assistant and you are looking at two remote sensing images. 
What you see are provided with five sentences, describing the differences between the two images.
Please design a conversation between you and a person who asks for information about the difference of these two images. The answer should be in a tone that a visual AI assistant is looking at the images and answering questions. Ask different questions and give corresponding answers.
Please ask questions about the changes in the visual content of the image, including whether a change has occurred, how much has changed, the category of objects that have changed, the location of objects that have changed, a detailed description of the changes, etc.
Don't ask questions that don't have a definite answer, and provide clear answers when answering complex questions. Don't output anything other than the question-answer pair.
